    "text": "A regional view of the past with applications to the present. Python spatial and tabular analysis using multiple variables to look at a single time slice. This code can be a combination of cloud and local based analysis. A purpose for this exercise is to use use public research data for derived conclusions view the impacts climate change has on agriculture a look at what farmers can do and why we need to support them.\nNASA Acres has defined the Essential Agricultural Variables or EAVs. These were designed by NASA Acres to define the capabilities of the top satellite data scientists and practitioners who make up NASA Acres Research, Development, and Extension partners, and the needs of decision-making-collaborators already in our network, to identify an initial set of focus.\n\nCropland and Crop Type Mapping\nCrop and Crop Type Area Estimation\n\nDerived results will be the county level statistics of impacts of harvestable acreage. To achieve this, a basic workflow we can\n\nUse api to call in the CDL dataset to map crop types.\n\nThen\n\nAccess the Sea level rise (elevation dataset) to identify new areas of potential areas that are at risk of future flooding. Clip to county of interest\nCompare the CDL with the SLR mask and with out to identify the NOAA estimated loss of land.\n\nThen using MODIS create a time series for NDVI of the masked crop land, derive insights about trends in NDVI\n\nUse NDVI to create a time series looking backwards in time at areas that have experienced flooding to visualize the moving from productive farms to moderate quality.\n\nThis all together would allow us to make a predictive analysis for Maryland in the future under the projections of sea level rise. Given the current conditions, subtracting the sea level rise inundated areas. Then given the remaining areas, making predictions about the trends of NDVI given the trends in historical areas that are near impacted areas. We cannot say that “sea level rise is driving the decrease” because there are many other factor and decisions that farmers make around how much to plant, how much to harvest, chemicals applied, growing degree days, soil and soil moisture conditions. But this module should provide the ability to make insights about potential causes and impacts.\nThe data story that we have derived is about sea level rise in Maryland and the impact that it has on the production levels with in the state. From this module, we can provide students with the ability to draw from multiple data sources, as well as derive insights using historical and future viewing data sets.\nThe U.S. Mid-Atlantic has seen higher rates of sea level rise, marshes may be especially vulnerable. “In the Chesapeake Bay, sea level rise has already contributed to the degradation of over 80,000 ha (70%) of tidal marsh” (Taylor et al. 2020). This view can help us to understand the impacts that small levels of sea level rise have on land.\nWe can prompt the user to think about future impacts outside the direct sea level rise projections, allowing them to include a more full picture, and finally using that picture to identify economic impacts that action or inaction causes. This begs the question, what can the public do to enact changes, rather than putting the pressure on farmers to change?\n\n!pip install arcgis arcgis-mapping rasterio earthaccess\n\nRequirement already satisfied: arcgis in c:\\users\\jmartine\\appdata\\local\\esri\\conda\\envs\\agsdev\\lib\\site-packages (2.2.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#import the required packages\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport rasterio\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom shapely.geometry import box\nimport numpy as np\nimport requests\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom io import BytesIO\nimport os\nfrom rasterio.warp import calculate_default_transform, reproject, Resampling\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n\n#define fuctions\n\ndef reproject_raster(src_dataset, src_crs, src_transform, dst_crs='EPSG:4326'):\n    dst_crs = rasterio.crs.CRS.from_string(dst_crs)\n    dst_transform, dst_width, dst_height = calculate_default_transform(\n        src_crs, dst_crs,\n        src_dataset.width, src_dataset.height,\n        *src_dataset.bounds)\n    dst_kwargs = src_dataset.meta.copy()\n    dst_kwargs.update({\n        'crs': dst_crs,\n        'transform': dst_transform,\n        'width': dst_width,\n        'height': dst_height})\n    dst_data = np.zeros((src_dataset.count, dst_height, dst_width), dtype=src_dataset.dtypes[0])\n    for i in range(1, src_dataset.count + 1):\n        reproject(\n            source=rasterio.band(src_dataset, i),\n            destination=dst_data[i-1],\n            src_transform=src_transform,\n            src_crs=src_crs,\n            dst_transform=dst_transform,\n            dst_crs=dst_crs,\n            resampling=Resampling.nearest)\n    return dst_data, dst_kwargs\n\ndef format_cdl_url(fips,year):\n    base_url = \"https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/axis2/services/CDLService/GetCDLFile\"\n    url = f\"{base_url}?year={year}&fips={fips}\"\n    return url\n\ndef get_srl_raster():\n    slr_path = 'data/MD_East_slr_depth_3_5ft.tif'\n    with rasterio.open(slr_path) as slr_raster:\n            slr_meta = slr_raster.meta\n            slr_meta['nodata'] = 0\n            slr_reprojected, slr_meta_reprojected = reproject_raster(src_dataset=slr_raster, src_crs=slr_meta['crs'], src_transform=slr_meta['transform'])\n    return slr_reprojected, slr_meta_reprojected"

As things change, we can tell how much and what is actually changing because we have mapped and studied this area. The need for accurate, consistent study within these areas of agriculture is vital for describing changes as they occur.\n\nWhat is Remote Sensing?\nRemote sensing is the action of measuring the reflectance of energy from objects. For this module we are using Landsat, a passive satellite that relies on the sun to send out energy and the sensor measures the reflectance.\n\nFrom this, we can use both the visible (red, green, blue) reflectance and the infrared light to detect objects on the ground.\nThis is an example of a Landsat image. Compared to the aerial image, the Landsat image appears pixelated. This is because Landsat takes all the reflectances within each 30 by 30-meter square in the ground to get one value.\n\nGenerate the pull for the NDVI data. This data pull comes from The Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples (AppEEARS), which offers a simple and efficient way to access data archives. We will use Landsat for this module, but a variety of datasets are available.\n\nNDVI is a commonly used calculation as an indicator for the health of vegetation based on the ratio of reflectance of red to near-infrared values within the electromagnetic spectrum.

    "text": "Working with Rasters\n\nReading Raster Data\nThere are two ways to display information: vectors (points, lines, polygons) or rasters. Rasters are continuous sheets that are layered across a space; they are made up of pixels. Each pixel represents the ground beneath it. For example, if a raster pixel is 30 by 30 meters, that means a single pixel represents 30 by 30 meters on the ground.\n\nfips = \"24041\" # County code for all US counties, remember we called this in the first code chunk when we used the geojson to gather Landsat NDVI images\nyear = 2018 # Year of interest\n\n# The CDL (crop data layer) is the authoritative data layer for the US crops\nbase_url = \"https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/axis2/services/CDLService/GetCDLFile\"\n\n# Pulling the data from the online source using the requests library allows us to access the data without needing to download the dataset\nresponse = requests.get(f\"{base_url}?year={year}&fips={fips}\")\nprint(response.content)\nroot = ET.fromstring(response.content)\ntif_url = root.find('.//returnURL').text\ncdl_data = rasterio.open(tif_url)\ncdl_meta = cdl_data.meta\ndata = cdl_data.read(1)\n\nb'&lt;ns1:GetCDLFileResponse xmlns:ns1=\"http://cropscape.csiss.gmu.edu/CDLService/\"&gt;&lt;returnURL&gt;https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/webservice/nass_data_cache/byfips/CDL_2018_24041.tif&lt;/returnURL&gt;&lt;/ns1:GetCDLFileResponse&gt;'\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying Raster Data\nMISSING TEXT\n\nbounds = transform_bounds(cdl_data.crs, 'EPSG:4326', *cdl_data.bounds)\n\n# Calculate the center of the image for the map\ncenter_lat = (bounds[1] + bounds[3]) / 2\ncenter_lon = (bounds[0] + bounds[2]) / 2\n\n# Create a base map centered on the image\nm = folium.Map(location=[center_lat, center_lon], zoom_start=10)\n\n# Add the raster layer to the map\nimg = folium.raster_layers.ImageOverlay(\n    data,\n    bounds=[[bounds[1], bounds[0]], [bounds[3], bounds[2]]],\n\n)\nimg.add_to(m)\n\n# Add the colormap to the map\n\n# Add layer control\nfolium.LayerControl().add_to(m)\ndisplay(m)\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nZoom around in on the map. Look at the raster structure, the squares stacked next to each other, representing an area on the ground.\n\n\nSpatially Project Raster Data\nWhen working with geographic data, we have to begin by knowing that all of our data is in the right space on the globe. We begin with a function for reprojecting rasters. This is one of the keys when working with spatial data: ensuring that all of the data is based on the same spatial reference.\nReprojecting requires a resampling method; for this, we use the nearest neighbor’s resampling.\n\n\ndef reproject_raster(src_dataset, src_crs, src_transform, dst_crs):\n    # Convert the destination CRS string into a CRS object that rasterio can use\n    # For example, 'EPSG:4326' becomes a python coordinate object\n    dst_crs = rasterio.crs.CRS.from_string(dst_crs)\n\n    # Calculate the new dimensions and transformation matrix for the output raster\n    # This ensures the whole image fits in the new coordinate system\n    dst_transform, dst_width, dst_height = calculate_default_transform(\n        src_crs,                    # Current coordinate system\n        dst_crs,                    # Target coordinate system\n        src_dataset.width,          # Current image width\n        src_dataset.height,         # Current image height\n        *src_dataset.bounds         # The geographical bounds of the image\n    )\n\n    # Copy the metadata from the source dataset\n    # This includes things like data type, number of bands, etc.\n    dst_kwargs = src_dataset.meta.copy()\n\n    # Update the metadata with the new CRS, transform, width, and height\n    dst_kwargs.update({\n        'crs': dst_crs,\n        'transform': dst_transform,\n        'width': dst_width,\n        'height': dst_height\n    })\n\n    # Create an empty array to store the reprojected data\n    # Shape is (number of bands, new height, new width)\n    dst_data = np.zeros((src_dataset.count, dst_height, dst_width),\n                       dtype=src_dataset.dtypes[0])\n    reproject(\n        source=rasterio.band(src_dataset,1),\n        destination=dst_data,             # Where to store the result\n        src_transform=src_transform,           # Current transformation\n        src_crs=src_crs,                      # Current coordinate system\n        dst_transform=dst_transform,           # New transformation\n        dst_crs=dst_crs,                      # New coordinate system\n        resampling=Resampling.nearest         # Use nearest neighbor resampling\n    )\n\n    # Return both the reprojected data and the updated metadata\n    return dst_data, dst_kwargs\n\n\n\nAccess data with API\nTo understand the nature of Maryland agriculture we can begin by using the CDL. This raster dataset comes at a 30-meter spatial resolution. We can access this data through their API. The current configuration allows data to be pulled at the county level.\nCOUNTY LEVEL CDL FOR FIPS\nThis view provides insight into the common commodities that are grown in Maryland in the desired year.\n\ncdl_reprojected, cdl_meta_reprojected = reproject_raster(cdl_data, cdl_meta['crs'], cdl_meta['transform'], 'EPSG:4326')\n\nThe eastern seaboard has seen changes in the sea level along with increased flooding and the decrease in the predictability of water flow from rivers.

    "text": "Understand the relationship between sealevel rise, salt water intrusion, and agricultural productivity in Maryland’s coastal regions\nLearn to work with and analyze multiple types of geospatial data (raster datasets) using Python\nInterpret vegetation health patterns using satellite-derived NDVI measurements\nEvaluate potential future impacts of sea level rise on agricultural land\n\nThis lesson will allow the learner to gain a deper understanding of the followinf concepts - Recognizing the economic importance of agriculture in Maryland - Understanding how sea level rise is impacting coastal farming - Identifying the role of remote sensing in monitoring environmental changes - Connecting local agricultural challenges to broader climate change impacts\nThis module can help to contextualize the impact of saltwater inundation. For this module, we will identify cropland, and then, using the NOAA sea level rise estimations, we can calculate the difference in productivity using NDVI as a measure of vegetation health. A graphical time series allows us to see areas impacted by sea level rise.\nFirst, we can find the county-level statistics of harvestable acreage. We are using the Crop Data Layer (CDL) from the United States Department of Agriculture National Agriculture Statistics Service (USDA NASS)\n\nUse API to call in the CDL dataset to map crop types.\n\nAfter getting familiar with the dataset, we can modify it. Because we are interested in the impact of sea level rise and the effect we can find that data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\nAccess the Sea level rise (elevation dataset) to identify new areas of potential areas that are at risk of future flooding. Clip to county of interest\nCompare the CDL with the SLR mask and without to identify the NOAA estimated loss of land.\n\nThen using Landsat create a time series for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the masked cropland, derive insights about trends in NDVI.\n\nUse NDVI to create a time series looking back in time at areas that have experienced flooding to visualize the movement from productive farms to moderate quality.\n\nThis all together would allow us to make a predictive analysis for Maryland in the future under the projections of sea level rise. Given the current conditions, subtracting the sea level rise inundated areas.\nThe data story we have derived concerns sea level rise in Maryland and its impact on production levels within the state. This module can help students draw from multiple data sources and derive insights using historical and future viewing data sets.\nWe can prompt the user to think about future impacts outside the direct sea level rise projections, allowing them to include a full picture and finally using that picture to identify economic impacts that action or inaction causes. This begs the question: What can the public do to enact changes rather than putting pressure on farmers to change?"
