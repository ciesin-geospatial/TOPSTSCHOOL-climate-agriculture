Welcome to the fourth module of the SCHOOL curriculum!

The Science Core Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning (SCHOOL) is part of the [NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS)](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) Training (TOPST) initiative, designed to teach the data science lifecycle using data from the NASA Earth Sciences division and to foster an inclusive culture of open science. You can learn more about the SCHOOL Project and other modules on the [SCHOOL Project home page.](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL/)

This TOPS SCHOOL module on the theme of 'Climate and Agriculture" provides a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between Earth's ecosystems, climate and human-induced climate change, and environmental justice. We will explore how we can use spatial data for the study of climate, agriculture, and their impacts on vulnerable communities. You will also gain critical insights into how a changing climate affect agricultural resources people rely on for food. As you engage with the lessons, you will develop a comprehensive understanding of key concepts of earth's climate system, the significance of social vulnerability to climate risks, and the tools available for analyzing environmental and agricultural data. Ultimately, these lessons will empower you to contribute meaningfully to discussions and actions pertaining to earth's climate, agricultural systems, and environmental justice.

**This module is designed to provide undergraduate students and early-career researchers with an introduction to the data science “life cycle” and sample code describing how Open Science principles can be effectively applied to earth sciences, particularly in the context of air pollution and its impact on health.**

Teaching earth science topics and coding skills in depth is beyond the scope of the SCHOOL Modules. Instead, the SCHOOL Project aims to provide users with the skills to adapt the skills learned in SCHOOL lessons to the users’ own Open Science workflow. To learn more about Open Science, explore [NASA's TOPS Open Science 101 Curriculum](https://openscience101.org/). To explore other themes in the SCHOOL project, visit our [Modules Page](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL/modules.html).

Module 4: Climate and Agriculture datasets and use cases cover:

*   **Understanding Human Exposure to Heat:** This lesson will use Google Earth Engine to analyze temperature and social vulnerability data.
    -   [Lesson 1: Understanding Human Exposure to Heat](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL-climate-agriculture/m401-human-exposure-heat.html)

*   **Flash Drought Multi-Indicator Analysis:** This lesson will use R and open source R packages to work with multiple drought indicators to understand rapid drought intensification and its agricultural impacts.
    -   [Lesson 3: Flash Drought Multi-Indicator Analysis](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL-climate-agriculture/m403-flash-drought-ag.html)


*   **NASA ACRES Climate Resilience Network:** This lesson will use public research data for derived conclusions and to view the impacts climate change has on agriculture.
