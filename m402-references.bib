  abstract = {The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) dataset is used to examine projected changes in temperature and precipitation over the United States (U.S.), Central America and the Caribbean. The changes are computed using an ensemble of 31 models for three future time slices (2021–2040, 2041–2060, and 2080–2099) relative to the reference period (1995–2014) under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs; SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5). The CMIP6 ensemble reproduces the observed annual cycle and distribution of mean annual temperature and precipitation with biases between −~0.93 and 1.27~°C and −~37.90 to 58.45\%, respectively, for most of the region. However, modeled precipitation is too large over the western and Midwestern U.S. during winter and spring and over the North American monsoon region in summer, while too small over southern Central America. Temperature is projected to increase over the entire domain under all three SSPs, by as much as 6~°C under SSP5-8.5, and with more pronounced increases in the northern latitudes over the regions that receive snow in the present climate. Annual precipitation projections for the end of the twenty-first century have more uncertainty, as expected, and exhibit a meridional dipole-like pattern, with precipitation increasing by 10–30\% over much of the U.S. and decreasing by 10–40\% over Central America and the Caribbean, especially over the monsoon region. Seasonally, precipitation over the eastern and central subregions is projected to increase during winter and spring and decrease during summer and autumn. Over the monsoon region and Central America, precipitation is projected to decrease in all seasons except autumn. The analysis was repeated on a subset of 9 models with the best performance in the reference period; however, no significant difference was found, suggesting that model bias is not strongly influencing the projections.},

  abstract = {Simulating the impacts of future climate change on water footprints and crop production allows for selecting alternative crops for mitigating climate change effects. In this study, climate change impacts on irrigated grain corn, grain sorghum, winter wheat, and dryland (rainfed) winter wheat in the Palo Duro watershed of the Texas High Plains were assessed using an improved Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model with an enhanced irrigation representation of management allowed depletion (MAD) irrigation scheduling. Climate change analyses in this study used the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate projections of 11 General Circulation Models (GCMs) under four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios of RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 during two 30-year periods of the middle (2040-2069) and end (2070-2099) of the 21st century to compare to a baseline period of 1970-1999. For the irrigated summer crops of corn and sorghum, all 11 GCMs predicted the reductions of future irrigation, crop evapotranspiration (ETc), and yields compared to the baseline period. According to an ensemble of 11 GCMs, the simulated reductions in average annual irrigation, ETc, and yield for the irrigated corn were 63\%, 34\%, and 13\%, respectively, at the end of the 21st century under the severe emission scenario of RCP8.5. Those values were 80\%, 34\%, and 34\% under the irrigated sorghum land use. As for the irrigated winter wheat, the decreases in future irrigation and ETc were also identified in all GCMs relative to the baseline period. However, irrigated wheat yields were increased in the future climate. The changes in dryland wheat ETc were consistent with the rainfall variation under all climate change scenarios. Generally, the future climate could benefit the dryland wheat yields. A large uncertainty was found for the surface runoff simulations under both irrigated and dryland wheat according to various GCMs.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to perform trend analysis in the historic data sets of annual and crop season [May–September] precipitation and daily maximum and minimum temperatures across the southwest United States. Eighteen ground-based weather stations were considered across the southwest United States for a total period from 1902 to 2017. The non-parametric Mann–Kendall test method was used for the significance of the trend analysis and the Sen’s slope estimator was used to derive the long-term average rates of change in the parameters. The results showed a decreasing trend in annual precipitation at 44.4\% of the stations with the Sen’s slopes varying from −1.35 to −0.02 mm/year while the other stations showed an increasing trend. Crop season total precipitation showed non-significant variation at most of the stations except two stations in Arizona. Seventy-five percent of the stations showed increasing trend in annual maximum temperature at the rates that varied from 0.6 to 3.1 °C per century. Air cooling varied from 0.2 to 1.0 °C per century with dominant warming phenomenon at the regional scale of the southwest United States. Average annual minimum temperature had increased at 69\% of the stations at the rates that varied from 0.1 to 8 °C over the last century, while the annual temperature amplitude showed a decreasing trend at 63\% of stations. Crop season maximum temperature had significant increasing trend at 68.8\% of the stations at the rates varying from 0.7 to 3.5 °C per century, while the season minimum temperature had increased at 75\% of the stations.},

  abstract = {Extreme precipitation events damage infrastructure and property; thus, predicting future precipitation patterns in the context of climate change is important. In this study, precipitation projections from 36 downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) enabled examination of projected changes in future precipitation for the Clear Creek watershed in Houston, Texas, USA. Precipitation from 1950 to 2099 simulated with GCM were downscaled using the Bias-Correction Spatial Disaggregation method. Ten precipitation indices that represent precipitation amount, precipitation intensity, precipitation duration, and precipitation frequency evaluated how precipitation patterns will likely change. Results show that, at the annual scale, mean precipitation will significantly decrease based on RCP8.5, or remain relatively constant based on RCP2.6. Precipitation intensity and precipitation variability, however, will likely increase. Dry periods will lengthen significantly, whereas the length of wet spells will generally remain unchanged. At the monthly scale, the amount of precipitation, precipitation intensity, precipitation frequency and the length of wet spells will likely increase in September. In contrast, precipitation will likely decrease and dry spells will lengthen in April, May, August, November, and December. This finding illustrates that the intra-annual variability in precipitation will increase. The projected changes in precipitation under RCP8.5 are generally greater compared with RCP2.6. Differences between the scenarios are more pronounced towards the end of the century. Houston has recently experienced substantial precipitation variability, including severe drought and record-breaking precipitation from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. These events are consistent with the long-term GCM projections. Findings from this study can be applied to help manage water resources and enhance adaptability to climate change.},

  abstract = {Long-range water planning is complicated by factors that are rapidly changing in the 21st century, including climate, population, and water use. Here, we analyze climate factors and drought projections for Texas as an example of a diverse society straddling an aridity gradient to examine how the projections can best serve water stakeholder needs. We find that climate models are robust in projecting drying of summer-season soil moisture and decreasing reservoir supplies for both the eastern and western portions of Texas during the 21st century. Further, projections indicate drier conditions during the latter half of the 21st century than even the most arid centuries of the last 1,000 years that included megadroughts. To illustrate how accounting for drought nonstationarity may increase water resiliency, we consider generalized case studies involving four key stakeholder groups: agricultural producers, large surface water suppliers, small groundwater management districts, and regional water planning districts. We also examine an example of customized climate information being used as input to long-range water planning. We find that while stakeholders value the quantitative capability of climate model outputs, more specific climate-related information better supports resilience planning across multiple stakeholder groups. New suites of tools could provide necessary capacity for both short- and long-term, stakeholder-specific adaptive planning.},

  abstract = {There has been an alarming increase in the frequency of major flooding events along the Gulf Coast over the last three decades, primarily due to events of unprecedented, or extreme, rainfall. Using data from 63 rain gauges maintained by the Harris County Flood Control District's Flood Warning System (HCFCD FWS), this study examines the changes in daily precipitation amounts in the highly urbanized city of Houston, Texas, USA. The potential shift in annual precipitation patterns over a period of three decades (1989-2018) was examined by investigating the numbers of dry and wet days as well as annual precipitation totals over the study period. Wet days were then further scrutinized based on daily rainfall amounts (e.g., R10, R20, R30, R40, R50, R100) to determine if extreme events are beginning to dominate annual rainfall amounts. Trends were analyzed for statistical significance temporally using the Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope methods and for spatial trends using GIS applications. The results indicate a statistically significant increase in extreme rainfall at the expense of light, moderate, and heavy rainfall over time. The only negative relationship is found in dry days. The most statistically significant trends exist in the 99th percentile, maximum, and R100 parameters with p-values of 0.07, 0.08, and 0.11, respectively. There has been rapid growth and intensive development in the Houston area in recent decades that continues to this day, and land cover change has been significant as 12.6\% of Harris County changed to one of four National Land Cover Database (NLCD) Urban classes (e.g., developed: barren, low intensity, medium intensity, high intensity). This confirms that urbanization has continued to increase while total vegetative and wetland coverage has decreased. The findings of this study provide essential guidance for city and state planners and engineers.},

  abstract = {A thorough understanding of the peak flows under urbanization and climate change—with the associated uncertainties—is indispensable for mitigating the negative social, economic, and environmental impacts from flooding. In this paper, a case study was conducted by applying the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) to the San Antonio River basin (SARB), Texas. Historical and future land-cover maps were assembled to represent the urbanization process. Future climate and its uncertainties were represented by a series of designed scenarios using the Change Factor (CF) method. The factors were calculated by comparing the model ensemble from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) with baseline historical climatology during two future periods (2020–49, period 1; 2070–99, period 2). It was found that with urban impervious areas increasing alone, annual peak flows may increase from 601 (period 1) to 885 m3 s−1 (period 2). With regard to climate change, annual peak flows driven by forcings from maximum, median, and minimum CFs under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) were analyzed. While the median values of future annual peak flows—forced by the median CF values—are very similar to the baseline under all RCPs, in each case the uncertainty range (calculated as the difference between annual peak flows driven by the maximum and minimum CFs) is very large. When urbanization and climate change coevolve, these averaged annual peak flows from the four RCPs will increase from 447 (period 1) to 707 m3 s−1 (period 2), with the uncertainties associated with climate change more than 3 times greater than those from urbanization.},
